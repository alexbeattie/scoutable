# Tech Stack & Implementation Plan for Scoutable MVP

## Introduction

This document outlines a recommended technology stack for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Scoutable, a sports recruiting platform. The goal of this MVP is to quickly launch and validate the core concept of connecting athletes, coaches, and media, with an initial focus on the tennis community.

The following recommendations are optimized for:
* **Speed of Development**: To get the product to market and start gathering user feedback quickly.
* **Scalability**: To ensure the platform can grow as more sports and users are added.
* **Cost-Effectiveness**: To minimize initial infrastructure and operational costs.

## Part 1: Web Application MVP Recommendation

This is the recommended approach for building the initial desktop and mobile-web version of Scoutable.

### **Summary of Web App Tech Stack**

| Category               | Recommended Technology                                  | Why for an MVP?                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend (Web App)** | **React.js** with **Next.js**                           | Fast UI development, large talent pool, and great performance features out-of-the-box. |
| **Backend (API)**      | **Python** with **FastAPI**                             | High performance, rapid development, and future-proofs for planned AI features.        |
| **Database**           | **PostgreSQL**                                          | Balances structured data (user connections) and flexibility (diverse profile fields).  |
| **Server / Hosting**   | **Vercel** (for Frontend) & **Render** (for Backend/DB) | Easy to deploy, scalable, and cost-effective, minimizing DevOps workload.              |
| **File Storage**       | **Amazon S3** (or compatible)                           | Industry standard for reliably storing user-uploaded videos and images.                |

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Frontend (Web Application)**
* **Framework: React.js with the Next.js framework.**
    > The Scoutable mockups show a dynamic, data-rich platform with interactive profiles, feeds, and analytics dashboards. React is the ideal library for building these complex user interfaces. Next.js provides a powerful structure on top of React, offering performance benefits like server-side rendering and simplifying development.

* **UI Component Library: Material-UI (MUI) or Chakra UI.**
    > To accelerate development and match the clean aesthetic of the mockups, a component library is essential. These libraries provide pre-built, customizable components for forms, navigation, and data display, drastically reducing development time.

#### **Backend (Server and API)**
* **Language & Framework: Python with FastAPI.**
    >The product roadmap includes an AI Recruiting Assistant and other data-driven premium features. Python is the premier language for AI and data science, so starting with it builds a strong foundation for future development. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework that enables rapid API development and includes automatic documentation, which is a significant advantage for a small team.

#### **Database**
* **Database: PostgreSQL.**
    > The platform's data is highly relational: players connect with coaches, coaches belong to teams, and athletes have specific academic and athletic records. PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database perfect for managing these relationships. It also supports flexible JSONB data types, which are ideal for storing varied data like athletic achievements or ranking categories without needing to constantly alter the database structure.

#### **Server Technology & Hosting**
* **Platform: A PaaS like Render or the Vercel/AWS combination.**
    > **Frontend Hosting (Vercel)**: Vercel is built by the creators of Next.js and offers the most seamless deployment experience for a React/Next.js application.
    > **Backend & Database Hosting (Render)**: Render is a modern, developer-friendly cloud provider that simplifies hosting for backend applications and databases like PostgreSQL. Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) lets the team focus on building features, not managing server infrastructure.

#### **Essential Third-Party Services**
* **File Storage: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).**
    > The platform will allow players to upload videos and profile pictures. S3 is the industry standard for scalable, affordable, and reliable file storage.
* **Authentication: NextAuth.js or Auth0.**
    > The mockups show sign-in options via Google, Microsoft, and email. A dedicated service securely handles this complex functionality out-of-the-box.

## Part 2: Mobile Application MVP Recommendation

If the primary goal is a downloadable app for iOS and Android, the following stack is recommended.

### **Summary: Key Differences for Mobile App**

| Category          | Web App MVP           | **Mobile App MVP**                         | Key Change/Reason                                                              |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**      | React.js with Next.js | **React Native**                           | Cross-platform framework to build native iOS & Android apps from one codebase. |
| **Backend (API)** | Python with FastAPI   | Python with FastAPI                        | **(No Change)** The API serves data to any client.                             |
| **Database**      | PostgreSQL            | PostgreSQL                                 | **(No Change)** The data model remains the same.                               |
| **Key Services**  | File Storage, Auth    | File Storage, Auth, **Push Notifications** | Push notifications are essential for mobile app engagement.                    |

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Frontend (The Mobile App)**
* **Framework: React Native.**
    > React Native allows you to build one app using JavaScript that works on both iOS and Android. This cuts development time and cost in half compared to building two separate native apps. Since it uses React, you can share knowledge and even some code if you decide to build a web application later.

#### **Backend, Database, and Hosting**
* **No Change Required.**
    > The backend (FastAPI), database (PostgreSQL), and hosting solution (Render) recommended for the web application work perfectly for a mobile app as well. A mobile app is just another client that communicates with the same API to fetch and display data.

#### **Mobile-Specific Services**
* **Push Notifications: OneSignal or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).**
    > To keep users engaged, you'll need to send push notifications for things like new messages, connection requests, or profile views. These services provide the necessary infrastructure to reliably deliver notifications to both Apple and Android devices.

* **App Store Deployment: Expo Application Services (EAS).**
    > For a React Native app, EAS is a toolchain that dramatically simplifies the complex process of building the app and submitting it to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
